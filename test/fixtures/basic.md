# 3 reasons why Espen shouldn't be allowed to stay up late

It's 1 AM. Instead of going to bed and enjoying a good nights sleep,
I'm sitting at my computer with my feet in front of an electric heater,
trying to warm them up. I suppose that's almost a reason in itself, but
here's the three main reasons why I shouldn't be allowed to stay up late:

1. **New projects are spawned**
While this may not seem like a big deal, it is. Most days only contains 86400
seconds. Trying to maintain many projects over such a small amount of time
is hard.

2. **I can't listen to music**
The wife is sleeping in the room next to this one, and I'm too lazy to plug in
headphones - there is no front panel audio connector on this computer. Oh dear
god, I just found there actually is! Ok, scratch this whole point.

3. **Too much work goes into fixture files**
I mean, look at this thing. It may not be a masterpiece, but I now have more
than one thousand characters in this thing. Why didn't I just whip up some
lorem ipsum generator and be satisfied with that? Useless.
